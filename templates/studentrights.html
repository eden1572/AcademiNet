        <p>
            Welcome to the "Student Rights" website. Here you can find all the information
            about your rights as students and the latest updates in the academic world.</p>

    <section id="Appeals">
        <h2>Appeals</h2>
        <p>Test appeals is a procedure where students can submit a request for a re-examination of a test score or submitted work. Students can apply an appeal when they feel their test was not checked correctly, that there was a misunderstanding or they weren't given enough time to complete the assignment.
            According to the regulations of the specific academy or institution, students can file an appeal within a fixed time after receiving the grade or feedback.
            During the appeal process, a student can submit a request document detailing the reasons for the given grade or for a re-examination. The appeal will then go through an internal process in the institution that will decide if to approve the correction or to disapprove it.

            One of the most important rights for students is the right to receive quality teaching and fulfillment from the study plans.
            This right includes a few sub-categories such as access to information and course tools, access to up-to-date and quality course information that include study guides, course books, online materials, and more.
